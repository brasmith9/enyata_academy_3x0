Object Oriented Programming
Is a style of Programming centered around the idea of objects.
It is not a programming language, but rather a way of thinking about programming.
There are a lot of languages that are oriented towards object oriented programming,
but they are not object oriented programming languages.

eg.
C#
Java
Python
Ruby
JavaScript

Most of the popular frameworks are designed using the OOP principles.
eg. Django(Python), Angular, Laravel(PHP), Rails, Bootstrap, ASP.net, Express.js

4 Pillars/Concepts of OOP

- Encapsulation
  1. Reduces complexity
  2. Increase reusability
- Abstraction
  1. Reduces complexity
  2. Isolates the impact of change
- Inheritance
  1. Eliminate redundant code
- Poly-morphism
  many form
  1. Refactor switch/case, if...else statements


Procedural Programming
  Generally, the code is written in a sequence of steps.
  Data stored in variables and functions to act on them.
  Duplicate code is a major issure.

Solution
 OPP grouping the methods and properties into a unit.
  eg. localStorage

  
NB: The best functions are those with no parameters.

An object with more than one method has 'behaviour'

Ways of Creating Objects
1. Object Literals
2. Factory Functions
3. Constructor Functions
4. Class

Unlike Functions, Class declarations must be defined before they can be used/contructed.

Value vs Reference Types

Value Types         Reference Types
Number             Object
String             Function
Boolean            Array
Undefined          
Null              

NB: Primitives are copied by value whiiles objects are copied by reference
